# ConfidentialVote - FHE-Powered Corporate Governance DApp

## Project Overview
A corporate governance platform using Zama Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology, supporting confidential shareholder voting. The voting process is encrypted to ensure privacy, with transparent results. Suitable for board elections, budget approvals, etc.

## Key Principles
- **Confidential Voting**: Encrypts voting data using FHE.
- **Corporate Governance**: Supports strategic decisions like board elections and dividend policies.
- **Real-Time Verification**: Combines Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK) to ensure validity.
- **Decentralized**: Built on Ethereum blockchain.
- **Transparent Results**: Aggregated results are public, but individual votes remain private.

## Use Cases
- Board member elections
- Dividend distribution policies
- Budget approvals

## Frontend Usage Guide
1. Connect to Sepolia testnet using MetaMask.
2. Verify shareholder identity.
3. Create proposals (board members).
4. Vote (shareholders).
5. View results.

User Roles:
- **Board Members**: Create proposals.
- **Shareholders**: Cast votes.

Interface: Responsive design, integrated with MetaMask.

## Technical Architecture
- **Smart Contract Layer**: Zama fhEVM, OpenZeppelin security libraries.
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, Ethers.js, TailwindCSS, FHE client library.
- **Deployment**: Ethereum Sepolia testnet, future IPFS storage.

## Core Functionality
- FHE Encryption: Votes encrypted on the frontend.
- Smart Contracts: Store encrypted votes, aggregate results.
- Access Control: Only verified shareholders can vote.

## Development and Deployment
### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- MetaMask
- Git

### Installation
1. Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-zama-dapp.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure .env: Copy .env.example, add contract addresses.

### Local Development
- Run frontend: `npm start` or open index.html.
- Deploy contracts: Use Hardhat to deploy on Sepolia testnet.

### Testing
- Smart contract tests: Using Mocha.
- Frontend tests: Browser-based vote simulation.
- Security audits: Gas optimization, FHE compatibility.
